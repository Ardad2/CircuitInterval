# CircuitInterval

This is a program developed by me using JavaFX to help in creating intervals for Circuit Training workouts. This is my first attempt at creating an application with JavaFX and 
what I learnt in my University's CSE 205 class really helped me in learning JavaFX and its applications. I plan to recreate this app on Android studio once I upgrade my Computer's
specifications.

Features
1) Add workouts with their name and time. Rest can also be added.
2) You can adjust the workout list by removing or moving the workouts
3) You can start and pause the current process any time.
4) You're redirected to a larger screen in which the name of the current workout along with its time is displayed to provide ease in tracking which workout has to be done.
5) In total there are three screens: - The home screen, the workout list screen, and the timer screen.
